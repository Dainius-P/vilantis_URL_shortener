## About The Project

Implement a URL shortening service using Django in compliance with the requirements below. Use any additional software necessary. DO NOT use any 3rd-party URL shortening services, APIs or libraries. Format your code according to the PEP8 recommendations (you are free to choose your own favourite line length though). Document the options you've considered, their trade-offs and your decisions in the Readme file. Upload your solution to a public repo on GitHub and send us a link to it.
